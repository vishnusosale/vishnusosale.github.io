  I am Vishnu Sosale hacking at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com) as an [Android](http://www.android.com/) dev. I mostly spend my free time developing apps, watching movies and TV shows. I love Indian food and pizzas, chocolates and ice-creams are heaven ;). I occasionally collect coins. I live in Bengaluru.
