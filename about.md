  I am Vishnu Sosale working at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com) as an [Android](http://www.android.com/) dev and this website contains few tutorials and some of the best practices on Android to help anybody who has just started off to learn Android. This website helps you to learn by doing with examples and code. All the code in this website are [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and you can find the repos in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/vishnusosale).
