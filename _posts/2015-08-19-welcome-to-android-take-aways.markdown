Android Take-Aways is a blog where I help you to learn [Android](https://developer.android.com/index.html) by coding. This blog also helps you to build apps using the latest Android SDK, upload to [Google Play](https://play.google.com) and best practices to build an award winning app.

This blog assumes -  
1. You have setup Java environment in your dev machine.  
2. You have basic OOP concepts and preferably basics of Java.  
3. You have setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) in your dev machine.  

All the code show in this website are [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and you can find the repos in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/vishnusosale).

If you want to build apps that have more than a "Hello World" or a Button, this blog is for you!
